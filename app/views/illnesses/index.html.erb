<p class="welcome">
  Here at <span class="company">IllnessDetective</span>, our goal is to help people identify their illnesses by
  matching their symptoms with the diseases we have in our database. We have over 60
  illnesses stored in our database, from a common cold to leukemia. All people need
  to do is type in their symptoms into the search bar and wait for matching
  illnesses to come up.
